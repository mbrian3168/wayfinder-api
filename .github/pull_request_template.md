## Summary
Describe the change and why it’s needed.

## Endpoint Classification
- [ ] I added/changed endpoints and each controller method is annotated:
  - `@visibility public` — safe for unauthenticated usage / public docs
  - `@visibility partner` — requires partner auth; NOT for public docs
  - `@visibility internal` — ops/admin only

List routes touched:
- [ ] Method Path — `@visibility ____`
- [ ] Method Path — `@visibility ____`

## Safety Checks
- [ ] No secrets/PII in responses or examples
- [ ] Proper auth middleware applied
- [ ] Tenant scoping enforced
- [ ] Errors are generic (details logged privately)

## Screenshots/Testing notes
(How reviewers can verify)
